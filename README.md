# ProgrammingChallenges-Skiena-Revilla
This repository contains C and Python programs that solve problems in Steven S. Skiena &amp; Miguel A. Revilla's book *Programming Challenges*.

There are C programs for all problems in the book encountered so far, and Python programs for some problems where Python is more convenient (such as creating classes). While programs here might not use the most efficient methods, they work. All programs have been accepted by the UVa Online Judge (https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=28, requires log in) and run within the time limits posted for each problem. Program output was checked against accepted output from uDebug (https://www.udebug.com). Problem Titles and UVa Online Judge problem IDs are included in code files.

C programs were compiled identical to how they are compiled on UVa Online Judge, using: ANSI C 5.3.0 - GNU C Compiler with options: -lm -lcrypt -O2 -pipe -ansi -DONLINE_JUDGE (ONLINE_JUDGE is defined)
Python programs were written and run under Python 3.5.1
