# ProgrammingChallenges-Skiena-Revilla
C and Python programs that solve problems in Steven S. Skiena &amp; Miguel A. Revilla's book Programming Challenges.

There are C programs for all problems in the book encountered so far, and Python programs for some problems where creating classes in Python is more convenient. While the code here might not use the most efficient methods, they work. All programs have been accepted by the UVa Online Judge (https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php) and run within the time limits posted for each problem. Program output was checked against accepted output from uDebug (https://www.udebug.com).
